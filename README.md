# This is a contract with a digital agency to design and create a custom WordPress landing page and WooCommerce shop utilizing WordPress and WCAG best practices for better user experience and future compatibility.

<br>

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introduction

- The landing page features several custom modal overlays, a slideout mobile menu, image and video lightboxes, and native re-usable web components built with Lit for maximum past and future compatibility. The shop is customized by configuring WooCommerce and Storefront hooks to properly modify content while maintaining compatbility with other plugins. I advised on project scope and timeline, as well as managed and trained junior developers on Agile methodology and proper use of code and templates. Screenshots included below include agile project management with a kanban board, full landing page screenshot on desktop and mobile, as well as full page screenshots of the shop archive template and shop single template.
